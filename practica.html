<div> <h2 class="centrado">Practical example </h2>
    <p>For this practice I will use the first work done in the class, since I created a project which contains two branches and the gitflow can be said to work between branches, as shown in the image, make a change in branch2, which only it was modification in html code, I am comparing the changes</p></div>
    <br><br>
    <div><img src="img/img2.jpg"></div><br>
    <p>When saving those changes we go to github and we will see a message like the following, by clicking you can comment and review what branch2 updated </p>
<br><br>
<div><img src="img/img3.jpg"></div><br>
<p>This page should come out when you click, as you can see you can comment on what happened in that branch </p>
<br><br>
<div><img src="img/img4.jpg"></div><br>
<p>We changed to the master branch, being here it will not give a message informing us that there were changes in branch2, we can update the master branch so that the new information that we placed in branch2 appears or we can deny those changes</p>
<br><br>
<div><img src="img/img5.jpg"></div><br>
<p>The use of gitflow is very useful to me since you can work without fear of erroneous code since it can be said that you are doing it as a backup, since you can create different branches in which you can work as much as you want. </p>
